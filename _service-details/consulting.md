Perhaps you are not yet ready for a full-fledged security program, for any of a number of valid reasons. Or maybe your security program is already mature, but you still need advice on a specific issue from an expert in security architecture.

For smaller projects, we can provide Standalone Consulting as needed. This would include meetings, staff interviews, and group discussions on-site as needed, as well as any additional information gathering, in-depth research, and hands-on proof of concepts we may need.
