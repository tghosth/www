Threat modeling, a structured methodology for security-based analysis of a complex system, can help you identify and prioritize potential threats and attack vectors, and understand the appropriate mitigations.

A good threat model is essential for a robust, secure design and architecture, and can support mitigation of all relevant threats. This can also build customer confidence.

Our primary objective is to help you get to your end goal as quickly and effectively as possible. Your architects and development teams should be responsible for the security of their products, and consider this aspect as a normal part of building the features. As an outcome of this workshop, they will have the skillset, knowledge, and experience to be able to build basic threat models themselves, and recognize when they need to consult with experts for more advanced analysis.
