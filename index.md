#### About Bounce Security

At Bounce Security, we care about doing security the right way.

For us, that means focusing on protecting what _really_ matters. Instead of wasting your limited resources on generic, so-called "best practices", draining your developers’ cycles or squandering budget on expensive and ineffective consultants.

That is why we’ve developed our "**Value Driven Security**" approach, to save you time and money, and to enable a more efficient security process.

"Value-Driven Security" is a much better fit than common purist approaches, for modern development teams looking to design and implement security features in their software, without disrupting their natural flow.

Having a strong technical background and an intelligent risk analysis framework in place not only helps discover security risks, but also allows us to make pragmatic decisions and recommend _against_ spending on risks that do not affect your bottom line.
